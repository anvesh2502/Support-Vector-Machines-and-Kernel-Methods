# Support-Vector-Machines-and-Kernel-Methods
An svm which predicts whether people with certain characteristics are likely to be friends.

This analysis uses the Facebook friends dataset to predict the users who are more likely to become friends.The algorithm used in this analysis
is an advanced classification method called the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF(radial basis function).The reason for the selection
of this algorithm is the application of dot product between features which helps us build a better classifier than the decision trees and 
the linear classifier.The SVM is used from the python Scipy module.
